# Tokyo Event Checker
This app shows events in Tokyo scraping multiple sites using Puppeteer and generates a JSON file.
Then, with using the data, React/Typescript app renders the content to the view.

Although there are many websites sharing the information of events, most of them are separated. So, I thought it would be nice to have an app to view them in a page ðŸ˜‰
